For this lab, we worked together as a team to create our group portfilio. We were able to effectively split up different pages of the website to efficiently complete this assignment. Nicole worked on the landing page, Courteney worked on the previous works page, Dana worked on the meet the team page, and I worked on the resume format page. We wanted the CSS of the resume page to match each others' and match the theme of the group portfolio website. I was able to complete most of the page using my knowledge of HTML and CSS from the Intro to ITWS class from last year. However, I had to search up some documentation on CSS formating, such as using flexboxes. Additionally, the team and I did not know what microformats were, so we had to do some research together to implement this on the resume format page. Below are the websites I used as a reference:
