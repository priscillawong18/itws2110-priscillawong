For this lab, I created tables, modified them, and inserted content into them using SQL in PhpMyAdmin. More specifically, I created two tables named courses and students with some fields. Then, I added more fields to these tables and created a grades table. I also inserted courses, students, and grades data into the database. I was then able to list out specific information. This was a great experience, as I was able to practice SQL queries and see how they affect the database. I did not run into any trouble while completing this lab. 

Structure and content of the database is in websyslab8.csv

SQL Commands and output are in WebSystems_Lab8_Priscilla_Wong.docx
