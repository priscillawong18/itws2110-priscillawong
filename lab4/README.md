Prompts I gave Gemini:

Create a fully functioning weather website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks). Use the OpenWeatherMap API and one other API to get information to display on the site. Please keep into consideration the following requirements: getting data from APIs (AJAX), manipulating data received from APIs (JSON), quality HTML/CSS/JS, and creativity.

Can you make the location default to the user's current location? If the location is not able to be detected, can you default it to Troy, NY?

Can you make the circle button around the "search" button more oval-shaped so that the oval button is behind the text? It is currently a circle that is misaligned from "search."
