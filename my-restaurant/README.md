For this quiz, we were tasked with creating a menu website that displayed data from a JSON file. I wanted to keep the menu website simple, easy to read and minimalistic. It includes all the details necessary, such as the name of the dish, description, category, cuisine, ingredients, price, and photo. I used a simple sans-serif font called Poppins because it was easy to read and matches the overall theme of the website. I also chose colors that would make the images of the food stand out more to make it more appealing.
